A simple game of tic-tac-toe.
I am currently working on it and trying to add some new things to it to within my possibilities. At the moment the game has levels and a little advanced (lol) system to play the PC vs the player.

**Currently working on:**
- Improving the look of the program
- Adding something that enters my head

**In the future, he wants to add:**
- I want to make my small console program with different games

***Fun fact***
*Almost the entire computer game system is based on ```if```. This means that the computer checks the boxes and tries to choose the best move. I will try to reduce this amount of ```if``` at some point.*
```c
    if (board[1][1] == COMPUTER && board[2][2] == COMPUTER && board[0][0] == ' ') {
        board[0][0] = COMPUTER;
        return 1;
    }
```
